## Client Communication & Dashboard
Each user can run .py program to start a window where they can choose to wait for call on certain port or initiate a call to someones ip/port. The client will allow user to film themselves (show the live video feed and facial landmark recognition locally) while sending the landmark recognition/facial model to the counterparty, which will reconstruct the face using only the landmark/facial model and initial calibration. A dashboard on the side of the video input/output showcases key statistics/debug info for each client including: data transfer total & rate, length of call, etc.
